   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a donkey.

    Being a donkey includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a donkey.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER donkey.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a donkey would make loads off this work and not buy the original works 
creator(s) a pint.

 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and complaining when it goes wrong makes 
you a donkey. Fix the problem yourself. A non-donkey would submit the fix back.
